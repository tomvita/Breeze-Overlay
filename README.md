7. Some games make full use of every key so holding some key down is at times inconvenient and at other times not practical. There are also cases when most of the time you want the code enabled but occasionally you want to be able to quickly disable it. Moon Jump is very often going to prevent dropping down from platform. A quick way to disable moon jump is a good use case for this feature.
